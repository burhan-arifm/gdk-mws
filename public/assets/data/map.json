Now that it has moved from Mall @Alam Sutra to Living World makes it more open to the market as it is more crowded. But as it is located on the 2nd floor at the corner, next to Pendopo makes it hard to be found."

She explain me about their course step by step and tell me about the charge fee, but she didn't force me to join the course, she just wanted me to know about that course. She explain me that this course is really flexible and you can go there anytime without schedule. I think it is really fun."},
